/* Open questions:
   1. Precompute more of the L_i values?

   2. Since processing of the auth data is independent of the nonce, can
      we have some interface for reusing the same auth data with several messages?

   3. Nonce processing seems intended to allow for incrementing the
      nonce cheaply, via the "stretch" bits. Should we implement this,
      maybe as auto-incrementing the nonce (like umac)?
